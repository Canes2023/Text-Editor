# Text-Editor

For this challenge, I was tasked with creating a functional Text Editor that runs in a browser. In this text editor, the user is able to click on the install button and J.A.T.E will install on the users system without issues and then the user can begin typing in the editor and console logging their stuff. All webpack plugins have been generated as well. Since I tested today (03/06/24), the application hasn't had any errors in the console and has been functioning without problems. The text editor creates a IndexDB database when opening the text editor as well. Application is also successfully deployed on Render without issues. I added ny name initials (DC) into the repo name in Render as requested by the last grader so that the name is unique.
